# canary-packages

"Canary packages" are strategically deployed NPM packages that contain carefully crafted credentials, tokens, or payloads designed to trigger alerts when accessed by automated scanners or malicious actors. Similar to canaries in coal mines that warned miners of toxic gases, these packages serve as early warning systems that reveal who is monitoring the NPM ecosystem, what they're looking for, and their detection capabilities. 

Canary packages are an important tool for security researchers because they provide unprecedented visibility into the hidden security monitoring infrastructure of package registries, expose blind spots in detection systems, and help identify potential nation-state actors' interests in supply chain surveillance. By analyzing who accesses these packages and which baits they respond to, researchers can map the effectiveness of existing security controls and identify vulnerabilities in our collective software supply chain defenses.
